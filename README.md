# Project Title

**A robust and scalable application infrastructure managed with Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, and Nginx Ingress.**

## Overview

This project leverages a modern cloud-native technology stack to provision and manage the infrastructure required to run our application. We utilize Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes as the container orchestration platform, Helm as the Kubernetes package manager, and Nginx Ingress as the entry point for external traffic.

This README provides an overview of the technologies used, the project structure, and instructions for setting up and managing the infrastructure.

## Technology Stack

* **Terraform:** An open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. We use Terraform to provision the underlying cloud resources necessary for our Kubernetes cluster and other dependencies.
* **Kubernetes (k8s):** A portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
* **Helm:** A package manager for Kubernetes. Helm charts define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications. We use Helm to package and deploy our application and its dependencies within the Kubernetes cluster.
* **Nginx Ingress Controller:** An Ingress controller that uses Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer. It provides HTTP and HTTPS routing from outside the cluster to services within the Kubernetes cluster based on rules defined in Ingress resources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

* **Terraform:** [Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
* **kubectl:** The Kubernetes command-line tool. [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* **Helm:** The Kubernetes package manager. [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* **Cloud Provider CLI:** (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI, gcloud CLI) configured with the necessary credentials to provision resources on your chosen cloud provider.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the infrastructure:

1.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    ```bash
    cd terraform
    terraform init
    ```

2.  **Review and Modify Terraform Variables:**
    Examine the `terraform/variables.tf` file and provide appropriate values in a `terraform.tfvars` file or through environment variables. This will include details like your cloud provider region, instance types, etc.

3.  **Plan Terraform Infrastructure:**
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
    Review the output carefully to understand the resources that will be created.

4.  **Apply Terraform Infrastructure:**
    ```bash
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```
    This command will provision the necessary infrastructure on your cloud provider, including the Kubernetes cluster.

5.  **Configure `kubectl`:**
    Once the Kubernetes cluster is provisioned, you will need to configure `kubectl` to interact with it. The specific steps for this will depend on your cloud provider. Terraform outputs might provide the necessary information.

6.  **Install Nginx Ingress Controller:**
    Navigate to the `ingress/` directory and apply the Nginx Ingress controller manifest (or use Helm if a chart is available). Refer to the official Nginx Ingress Controller documentation for detailed installation instructions.
    ```bash
    cd ../ingress
    kubectl apply -f nginx-ingress.yaml
    ```
    **Note:** You might need to adjust the manifest based on your cloud provider's load balancer setup.

7.  **Install the Application using Helm:**
    Navigate to the `helm/` directory and install the Helm chart for your application.
    ```bash
    cd ../helm
    helm install <release-name> . -n <namespace>
    ```
    Replace `<release-name>` with a name for your application release and `<namespace>` with the Kubernetes namespace where you want to deploy it.

8.  **Configure Ingress Rules:**
    Ensure that your application's Helm chart or Kubernetes manifests include an Ingress resource (likely in `kubernetes/ingress.yaml` or within the Helm chart's `templates/` directory). This Ingress resource will define how external traffic is routed to your application's services via the Nginx Ingress controller.

## Usage

Once the infrastructure and application are deployed:

* Access your application through the public IP or DNS name associated with the Nginx Ingress controller, as defined in your Ingress rules.
* Use `kubectl` to monitor the status of your application pods and services:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
    kubectl get services -n <namespace>
    kubectl get ingress -n <namespace>
    ```
* Use Helm to manage application upgrades, rollbacks, and configuration changes:
    ```bash
    helm upgrade <release-name> . -n <namespace> -f values-production.yaml # Example upgrade
    helm history <release-name> -n <namespace> # View release history
    helm rollback <release-name> <revision> -n <namespace> # Rollback to a previous revision
    ```
* Modify Terraform configurations in the `terraform/` directory to scale your infrastructure or add new resources, and then apply the changes using `terraform apply`.
